#### _Second Independent Project (JS) for Intro at Epicodus, 06.02.2017_

#### By _**Calla Rudolph (<callarudolph@gmail.com>)**_

## Description

_This was my first Javascript Independent Project after just one week of practice work. It utilizes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery. This was a mock survey for a user to make selections which would then define the best programming language for him to study. It includes input forms and select boxes. The inputs are then submitted into Javascript and assigned variables. Branching is then used within Javascript to define, or "show", a hidden answer div id within HTML, which is specific to a formula for the input variables that were selected by the user._
